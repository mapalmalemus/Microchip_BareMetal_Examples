# Microchip_BareMetal_Examples
 Microchip Full Scale Development
Learning for first time any enviroment for development embedde system or get to refresh old skills to be updated with all changes about new products, peroperialals, cpu architecturers 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits and almost very close 64 bits, memory, tools, c progamming, etc. It´s a big chanllenger to get be on track with amaizing technology which use each day to live our lifestyle. 

All notes were used to create applications with the most funtionalities to cover all features of microcontroller PIC16F628A, PIC12F683 and ATmega328P regarding its datasheet and try to apply multiple best practices of C programming following the MPLAB X Compiler User´s Guide for PIC Microcontrollers. Also, we´re sharing all kind of material like web references, PDF manaual links, video tutorials, githubs repositories, tools and shopping links as propietary as 3rd party.

For Embedded Systems projects always we can face to learn arround several skill which are normal or basic skills to everybody wants to develop with microcontrollers as 8 bits as 32 bits, we want to enumerate these basic skills as advanced skills or multidisciplinary skkills which are depended of the scale or compexity of the project or projects.

Basic Skills
1) Digital Ssytems.
2) Microcontrolles/Microprocessor Architectures. 
3) C/C++ Lenguage and specific Compliler Distribution.
4) IDE tools or Ecosystem tools (Collection Tools) of embeded systems manufacture (Microchip, Espressif, Texas Instrument, NXP, etc.) 
5) Git or subversion system used to get collaboration or example codes
6) Code Structure "Programming language alone does not ensure high readability and reusability, but good coding style does"
7)
