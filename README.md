# PIC16F628A_BareMetal_Blink
 Microchip Full Scale Development
Learning for first time any enviroment for development embedde system or get to refresh old skills to be updated with all changes about new products, peroperialals, cpu architecturers 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits and almost very close 64 bits, memory, tools, c progamming, etc. It´s a big chanllenger to get be on track with amaizing technology which use each day to live our lifestyle. 

All notes were used to create applications with the most funtionalities to cover all features of microcontroller PIC16F628A regarding its datasheet and try to apply multiple best practices of C programming following the MPLAB X Compiler User´s Guide for PIC Microcontrollers. Also, we´re sharing all kind of material like web references, PDF manaual links, video tutorials, githubs repositories, tools and shopping links as propietary as 3rd party.
